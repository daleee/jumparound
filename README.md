Jump Around is a 2D platformer that is simple to control yet
challenging to master. It was created as a small project to learn
about using the [Phaser game engine](http://phaser.io/). You can
[play the game here](http://dev.dale.io/jumparound/). A
[blog post](http://dale.io/2015/02/27/jump-around.html) was written
detailing some lessons learnt during the development of the game.

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies with NPM: `cd <cloned repo root> && npm install`
2. Use `./builder.sh serve` to run a local development environment
   When ready for packaging, run `./builder.sh build`.
